<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Michael Alex Basweti</h1>

<h2 align="center">Exeperience</h2>
<p>I have been privileged to work for some amazing companies and interact with intelligent and awesome software engineers worldwide. Below are the companies I have worked and some of the projects I have done:</p>

<h3>1. Andela Kenya Limited (September 2018-October 2019)</h3>
At Andela Kenya, I got a chance to work at the following projects:

â€¢	Converge â€“ Converge is a resource booking software which is used internally within the company. I oversaw integrating Google calendar API to the booking of rooms so that one can book a meeting room for a specific period and it will be reflected on the company calendar. The project is done in Python and GraphQL for backend and React-GraphQl for the frontend.
â€¢	Push Notification Microservice. This is a small microservice which sends notification to the converge application above anytime there is a change in the google calendar. The converge app the synchronizes itself to Google Calendar API.



<h3>1. Nation Media Group (October 2019-Present)</h3>
